abstract = {While robust trajectory following is a well-studied problem on mobile robots, the question of how to track accurately a trajectory on a humanoid robot remains open. This paper suggests a closed-loop trajectory tracking strategy aimed at humanoid robots. Compared to approaches from mobile robotics, this control scheme takes into account footsteps alteration, equilibrium constraints and singularities avoidance for humanoids. It provides a robust way to execute long and/or precise motion with the ability of correcting on-line preplanned trajectories in a very reactive manner. Results have been validated on the HRP-2 humanoid platform.},

abstract = {In this paper, we illustrate experimentally an original real-time replanning scheme and architecture for humanoid robot reactive walking. Based on a dense set of actions, our approach uses a large panel of the humanoid robot capabilities and is particularly well suited for 3D collision avoidance. Indeed A* approaches becomes difficult in such situation, thus the method demonstrated here relies on RRT. Combined with an approximation of the volume swept by the robot body while walking, our method is able to cope with 3D obstacles while maintaining real-time computation. We experimentally validate our approach on the robot HRP-2.},
